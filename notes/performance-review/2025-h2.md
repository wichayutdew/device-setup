      use cases with private cloud cron support
    - GTTD accuracy checker: Implemented automated GitLab integration for code
      quality validation
## Team Productivity & Measurement-Driven Approach
    - Drastically reduced activity-search resource utilization by removing JSON
      string conversion—measurable performance improvement
    - Implemented observability: OpenTelemetry metrics, Grafana
      dashboards with actionable alerts, Metabase dashboards
    - Actively sharing the knowledge to the team through sharing session and
      slack message
