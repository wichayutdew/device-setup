# **Individual Contribution** Over the past six months, I have  delivered
high-quality, scalable, and maintainable solutions across multiple projects. I
continuously pushing for pricing module to generate correct response and
allowing better performance, error handling and increasing more observability
capabilities. e.g. I closed out all the bugs/missing features that was missing
during the migration and including multiple more performance metrics to allow
better monitoring of success rate, response time of both user traffic and MSE
traffic. While talking about MSE traffic, I took a part in improving GTTD spark
pipeline with better logging/debugging capabilities by including multiple
structured logging system in the script allowing us to better catch error. I
also try to implement the origin-based pricing feature, even though the feature
is unusable due to high load to soybean it generates, but due to our work in
logging and measurement in both spark and pricing module, solving the load
issue should not be impossible, unlike what we faced when we are doing python
script. I have applied best practices in software engineering, such as clear
documentation (deployment guides, query tips, and many other confluence page),
and effective use of CI/CD pipelines. My estimations for deliverables have been
accurate, allowing for predictable sprint outcomes. When faced with complex
challenges—such as the Couchbase cache version issue for promocode—I approached
them creatively, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver timely
and effective solutions. I prioritized core business opportunities, such as
enabling the MSE clicked experiment and integrating customer VIP level data,
and many more.

# **Team Contribution** I have maintained open and effective communication with
peers, management, and stakeholders, ensuring alignment and transparency on
project goals and progress. My collaboration with other teams—such as
Promocode, PAAP, MSE, and Booking team enabling smoother cross-team initiatives
like the MSE clicked, generic soybean, and many other shared features. I have
actively supported team members, providing guidance on technical issues (e.g.,
helping P’Ieang and P’Mameaw with backend knowledges) and sharing knowledge
through documentation and walkthroughs. My contributions to the team
environment have been positive and constructive, as evidenced by my willingness
to assist with E2E testing, regression checks, and onboarding new processes
(e.g., PostgreSQL QA environment setup).

# **Culture** I have moved fast and efficiently, optimizing processes (e.g.,
automating DB migrations in activity-backoffice, streamlining deployment
pipelines for all activities services) and prioritizing high-impact work. My
approach has balanced short-term deliverables with long-term maintainability,
always considering the cost and value of my work. I embrace a scientific
mindset, regularly experimenting and measuring outcomes—such as through A/A
testing for MSE campaigns and detailed logging/metrics for new features. I am
open to feedback and new ideas, and I challenge existing processes
constructively to drive continuous improvement. I try take more responsibility
and see things end-to-end, from initial design to post-deployment verification
and documentation. Finally, I communicate directly and respectfully, providing
honest feedback and being receptive to input from others. I strive to maintain
a culture of openness, curiosity, and mutual respect, ensuring that all voices
are heard and that we collectively move towards better solutions.

# What are the top strengths you bring to your role that help you achieve
success? (List 1-3 areas)
1. **Technical Problem-Solving & System Design** I’m getting better at at
   identifying root causes of complex issues and designing scalable,
   maintainable solutions. My work on pricing module enhancements, error
   handling, and system migrations demonstrates my ability to deliver robust,
   future-proof systems.
    
2. **Cross-Team Collaboration & Communication** I build strong relationships
   across teams, ensuring smooth delivery of cross-functional projects.
   Proactively communicate with stakeholders and willing to support peers.
    
3. **Ownership & Continuous Improvement** I take full responsibility for
   end-to-end outcomes, from design to deployment and post-launch verification.
   I am committed to continuous improvement, regularly refining processes,
   automating workflows, and sharing knowledge to uplift the team.
    
# What are the top areas of development you need to focus on in the next 6
months to be more successful in your role? (List 1-3 areas)
1. **Strategic Planning & Prioritization** I want to further develop my ability
   to balance urgent tasks with long-term strategic initiatives, ensuring that
   my efforts consistently align with the highest business priorities.
2. **Mentoring & Leadership** While I support peers informally, I aim to take a
   more active role in mentoring and guiding junior team members, helping to
   build a stronger, more resilient team.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making** I plan to deepen my skills in leveraging
   data and analytics to inform technical decisions, experiment design, and
   feature validation, ensuring our solutions are both effective and
   measurable.

# Off the top of your head, list the things you need to achieve to be
successful in the next 6 months (business and behaviors)
- Lead or contribute significantly to at least one major cross-team initiative
- Proactively mentor and support team members, sharing knowledge and best
  practices ensure all critical systems are well-documented, with clear
  guidelines for deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- Continuously seek feedback and act on it, fostering a culture of openness,
  learning, and improvement.
